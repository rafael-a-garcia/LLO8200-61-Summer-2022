### Introductory and Organizational Materials

**Updating this for Spring 2022 - this sentence will be removed once updating is complete.**
This is the course website for Professor Garcia's sections of LLO 8200, Introduction to Data Science. Make sure you bookmark and check this page frequently for the most up-to-date files to use for both async and assignments. Over the course of the term code/files may be modified or corrected. I will upload updated files here when that happens. You should have R, RStudio, and the tidyverse package installed and updated prior to the first day of class. Instructions for installing/updating R and Rstudio can be found [here](./Downloading Installing Updating R and RStudio.pdf).

***All files should be accessed from THIS page (not the LMS) to ensure you have the most up to date information.*** 

You are responsible for reviewing and ensuring you are following the schedule and abiding by the policies outlined in the syllabus. The most up-to-date schedule and syllabus can always be found here and I will update the date when changes are made:  

 
[Schedule - Updated 01-12-2022](./Garcia_LLO8200_schedule_spring2022_v1.pdf)  
[Syllabus - Updated 01-12-2022](./Garcia_LLO8200_syllabus_spring2022_v1.pdf)

If you want to set up email alerts for updates/additions to this site, you can use the free version of a third-party program: [Distill](https://distill.io/). The free version will check for updates every six hours and send you alerts. Note: this is a platform that is not owned by Vanderbilt or me and you should review their data privacy and security to ensure you are comfortable with their practices.

### Assignments
Each assignment (problem set) should be uploaded to the LMS _before_ we meet for live session on the given due date. All assignment submissions must include two files to receive credit:
1. .Rmd code file.
2. "Knit" assignment file. The knit file can be in pdf or html (pdf is preferred). 

Note that you must upload BOTH files BEFORE you hit "submit" in the LMS; if you try to submit them one at a time, it will only allow you to upload one. Also, you are responsible for reviewing the files before uploading (check formatting, output, etc.). I will not accept submissions via email (unless there are extenuating circumstances). **There will be a penalty for submissions not meeting these requirements.**

All assignments are graded on a 100-point scale. Corrections can be submitted for any assignment and you can earn up to half of the deducted points back. You have one week from the time you receive feedback on the assignment to submit corrections.

### Additional Resources
Because our syllabus differs slightly from what's in the LMS, the gradebook calculations won't be entirely accurate. If you'd like to keep track of your current average, here is a tool to help you do so. This properly weights the various course elements (note that you'll need to put in some "estimated" grades to populate an average). 
* [Data Science Average Calculator](./Student Average Calculator.xlsx)

The YAML header conundrum... When you download an .Rmd file from this site, the YAML header will be removed (for some reason). Here is a sample header that you can reference when adding the header at the top of your .Rmd file. Remember, your header MUST begin on line 1 of your .Rmd file and the formatting must stay consistent in order for it to work (e.g., must begin with three dashes and end with three dashes).
